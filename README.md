# us_medical_insurance_costs
In this project, I analyze the correlation between age, sex, bmi, smoker, region and insurance charges. This analysis will include:

The data broken down into 4 different regions: northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest.

The difference in average medical insurance cost between smokers and non-smokers.

The average insurance cost of different age groups: youths: 18-24 years old, young adults: 25-35 adults: 35â€“55 years old, and elderly: > 55 years old.

The relationship between the number of children and BMI. BMI Scale: underweight: < 18.5, ideal: 18.5 - 24.9, overweight: 25 - 29.9, obesity: >= 30

The highest recorded medical insurance cost for the two different sexes: male and female.

The closest recorded medical insurance cost for patient zero: a 21 year old male, with a BMI of 27.0, who is not a smoker, lives in the northwest, and has no children.
